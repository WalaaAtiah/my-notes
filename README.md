### To avoid crying during your daily programming journey,you must master a few key points.
* First of all, you must understand the purpose of the program, your design should be easy for you and useful for others, so it can be - and will remain - as useful as possible,Programming is the process of reducing complexity to simplicity; By controlling complexity, not creating it, this will affect code maintenance.
 * One of the best ways to improve your design skills is to ensure that you fully understand the systems and tools you work with, THEN  Prioritizing;by understand that the  Changes that bring you more value and require less effort are better than those that bring you less value and require more effort.

* To solve any problem, you must understand it well, analyze the problem, process the information, and then break it down into smaller tasks and solve each separately, and don't expect the future. Just be as generic as you know you need to be in the moment.
